# This workflow automatically creates a documentation tracking issue in the dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs
# repository when a breaking change issue is opened or labeled in this repository.
#
# Setup Requirements:
# - A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) or GitHub App token with 'repo' scope must be configured
#   as a repository secret named 'DOCS_ISSUE_TOKEN' to allow creating issues in the docs repo.
# - If DOCS_ISSUE_TOKEN is not configured, the workflow will attempt to use GITHUB_TOKEN,
#   but this will likely fail due to insufficient permissions for cross-repository operations.
